Today, me and my friends held our annual Secret Santa tradition. Like every
year, my bot for it had bugs, and, like every year, everyone seemed to have
great fun. I love watching their faces on video, laughing and tearing through
layers of decorative paper. Everyone puts a lot of heart into their gifts,
making them personal, adding homemade stuff like drawings or cookies, picking
stuff they know the other person will like. For example, I got an amber, 
cute lava lamp. Such a thoughtful gift that made me very fuzzy inside,
because I always wanted one and I mentioned it to my friend. Once. Many
months ago. And she remembered! 
Other presents were very neat too: a pair of bunny slippers, a roll of camera
film, a handmade doll and a small skeleton guy my friend immediatelly loved
and decided to name Richard. 

Last two weeks were cold, dark and awful, but now I feel much better. Things
like this remind me I have my place in this world, filled by the best people.
