One sunny day, many, many years ago (I was probably 10-11 years old), I've
went to the nearby forest, like usual. But that particular day was special,
because I was going to build A Fort. A day before I've found an amazing
spot - a recess in the ground, big enough for someone small like me 
to fit into and comfortably sit, but not big enough to be at risk of suddenly
collapsing on me. It was in the middle of a small glade, secluded, surrounded
with berry bushes.

For the whole day I was picking moss and sticks to make a comfy floor and 
a ceiling with a little opening for me to slide through. When I finished,
the sun was setting, making the whole glade gold and reddish. It was time to 
go home soon. 

But I was just sitting here, first inside The Fort, then on the grass outside,
looking at it. I was really tired and had scratches on my hands and face,
but I can vividly remember just how overjoyed I was at that very moment.
Proud, even. 

I was coming there often for the next few weeks, to read, pick berries, listen 
to music on my MP3 player (the pill-shaped cheap one everyone else seemed 
to have) and do Fort's maintanence - replace broken sticks, get new moss etc.
It was amazing. But I never showed it to anyone, never took any pics, didn't
talk about it. I didn't need to, it was just me and my little, wonky creation,
as happy as one can be.
