The first post. I hope it wont be also the last! Probably not, lately I am
getting better with sticking to the stuff I do. In fact, things are getting
better in general. Tonight me and my friends are starting our annual Secret
Santa tradition - a few years ago I wrote a bot for this. 
Right after the Halloween, everyone registers their names and delivery details, 
and then the bot draws who is getting who as their giftperson. We all live in
different cities and rarely get to see each other, so I really like this
tradition, it lets us to be a little bit closer.

This year we also get some new people to join!

Over the years the bot got all kinds of small improvements, like making sure no
one is getting a person they are in a relationship with (because that would be
boring) and a person they already gave a gift the year prior.
In 2021 I also added (albeit a bit buggy) anonymous hint system, for people
who always have a problem with finding a perfect gift.

I am happy.
