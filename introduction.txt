  I am the owner of this site and the server it is served from.
Born in the same year the first PokÃ©mon game came out, (cis) woman,
living somewhere in a small plattenbau apartment in Central Europe
with my pets and the collection of old electronics - mostly microcomputers,
terminals, pocket organizers, and my trusted Technics turntable.

  While I dabble in all sorts of stuff from MSX to PS/2 machines, 
two m68k-based lines have the most special place in my heart - Amiga and 
Sharp X68000. Probably most of the technical content will be about them. 

  Last few months I spent restoring an X68k Super I imported from Japan in 
a non-working state. This is still an ongoing project, so stay tuned for
further updates.

  While I'm having the most fun with messing with hardware, I sometimes
touch the code too - in fact, along with my (much more experienced) 
friends I am keeping the scene alive as an Amiga demoscene coder.   _
                                                                 _ // 
        Only Amiga makes it possible!                            \X/

  I've created this space mostly because I need an outlet for my less
organized thoughts, where I can be more *myself*. I don't like the modern
Internet, especially social media. While I like sharing the stuff I do,
and I love meeting people who share my hobbies, I feel like everything there
is an over-sanitized popularity contest. I am just tired. 
Gopher probably won't replace my main site or other places where I am 
maintaining my online presence, but I hope it will give me some freedom
I really, really need.

  Thank you if you made it so far. And if you are my friend or a Loved One who
is reading this mostly because I was pestering you about checking out my newest
creation - thank you even more for putting up with me. 
And if you are one of those few people who are ready to dig this deep to 
hate-read about my life - don't worry, 
        I am doing great and I am loved!
   Sincerely hope you are too, whoever you are.


PS: If you are reading this, it means I am still alive, even if only
in your mind.
